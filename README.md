# Human-Digestive-System-CGProject
This project aims to demonstrate human anatomy such as digestive system, respiratory
system and excretory system using openGL. Digestive system shows the movement of food
in the body. Respiratory system shows the effect of inhalation and exhalation on lungs (i.e.
breathing). Excretory system shows the main organs involved in excretion.
These different anatomies are put in a menu and one can select the menu option for look into
a particular anatomy.
The main aim is to understand the key ideas and Implementation of Computer
Graphics using OpenGL for representing “HUMAN ANATOMY”. It is necessary to display
the object in the user’s point of view.
 The aim is to draw attention of users toward computer graphics.
 The aim is to create dominant project which is simple in use.
